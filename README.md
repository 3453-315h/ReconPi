ReconPi - A lightweight recon tool that performs extensive domain scanning with the latest tools using a Raspberry Pi and GO. After the installation the ReconPi only needs an internet connection and some power, easy does it.

Start using that Raspberry Pi -- I know you all have one laying around somewhere ;)

This project is in development. Pull requests are welcome!

## Installation

Check the updated blogpost here for a complete guide on how to set up your own ReconPi: [ReconPi Guide](https://x1m.nl/posts/recon-pi/) 


If you prepared your Raspberry Pi through the guide linked above you should be able to continue below.

> ReconPi v1.1.0 needs the Kali Pi image to work 100%!

Connect to your ReconPi with SSH:

```
$ ssh root@192.168.2.16 [Change IP to ReconPi IP]
```

Now we can set up everything, it's quite simple:

 - `git clone https://github.com/x1mdev/ReconPi.git`
 - `cd ReconPi`
 - `./install.sh`
 - The script gives a `reboot` command at the end of `install.sh`, please login again to start using the ReconPi.

Grab a cup of coffee since this will take a while.

## Usage

After installing all of the dependencies for the ReconPi you can finally start doing some recon!

```
$ recon <domain.tld>
```

`recon.sh` creates a directory named equal to the `domain.tld` provided within it's initial directory `$HOME/bugbounty`. It then starts the recon process.

Tools that are being used at this moment:

 - [Hypriot OS](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/)
